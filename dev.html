            <p style="font-size: 18px;">Hi, I’m Zakariya, a Software Engineering graduate and aspiring backend developer focused on building practical systems.
            This portfolio documents my journey from academic software engineering into industry-ready development. My work includes client-based university projects, random automation scripts and continuous learning projects such as the 100 Days of Code challenge.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 18px;">I’m particularly interested in Python backend development and scalable system design. I enjoy solving logical problems and turning ideas into functional software.
            Currently, I’m focused on strengthening my core programming fundamentals, data structures and problem-solving ability while building projects that reflect real engineering workflows.
            This site acts as my development “save point” , a record of progress as I work toward becoming a professional software engineer.</p>

                <p class="project-desc">
                  This group university project is a full-stack web application developed to automate the configuration of IoT routers for BT Group. It allows users to submit router requests with valid options, which the system then validates and converts into CSV outputs ready for BT’s automation pipeline. The tool significantly reduces errors and speeds up the deployment process. I personally contributed to designing, implementing, and testing the modules responsible for input validation and CSV generation, as well as integrating a chatbot to guide users through the ordering process.

                <p class="project-desc">
                  As part of a second-year group project, we built a web application for BipSync Cardiff to help their HR and IT teams manage new employee onboarding. The system provides dynamic checklists and a Kanban-style interface where tasks like laptop setup or account creation can be assigned, tracked, and marked complete. My contributions focused on implementing the logic behind task management and ensuring that the system allowed seamless tracking for both HR and other departments.

                <p class="project-desc">
                  This personal project automates the tedious process of unsaving posts on Reddit. Once activated, the script scrolls through a user’s saved posts and unsaves them automatically in batches, continuing until all posts have been processed. It runs entirely in the browser and requires no manual input beyond starting the script.

                  WIP – This is a personal coding challenge where I complete a Python project every day for 100 days to strengthen my programming skills. Projects range from games and quizzes to graphical simulations, each designed to explore a different programming concept or problem-solving technique. The repository demonstrates my learning process, persistence, and ability to build functional applications quickly from scratch.

                  Echoes of Elmwood is a university group project which uses voice-controls to navigate through an adventure game designed for players with visual or motor impairments. Users navigate through story episodes and make decisions using voice commands, while accessibility features like text-to-speech and adjustable interface settings ensure everyone can participate. I worked on implementing core gameplay functionality, user progress tracking, and features that make the game fully accessible and engaging for all players.

                  WIP – Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
